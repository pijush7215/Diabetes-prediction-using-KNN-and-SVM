# Diabetes-prediction-using-KNN-and-SVM
This project predicts the probability of being diabetic using SVM and KNN models on thePima Indians Dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and performance analysis with key metrics like accuracy, confusion matrices, and AU-ROC curves. A practical demonstration of applying classic ML algorithms to a critical healthcare problem.
